&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
### Example #1: CRM System Evaluation for Small Human Services Nonprofit

**Input:**
Our organization, Community Care Coalition, needs to evaluate CRM systems to better track client services and outcomes. We have 15 staff members and serve about 500 clients annually with housing support services. Our budget is approximately $8,000 for the first year (including implementation). We currently use spreadsheets and need better reporting for grant requirements.

**Thoughts:**
This is a small nonprofit with limited budget seeking a CRM solution specifically for client tracking. Key considerations include:
- Budget constraints ($8,000 all-in for year one)
- Need for outcome tracking and grant reporting
- Small team with likely limited technical resources
- Specific use case (human services client management)
- Migration from spreadsheets indicates need for simple adoption

I should focus on solutions with:
- Nonprofit-specific pricing and features
- Strong reporting capabilities for outcomes
- Simple implementation and training requirements
- Human services case management templates
- Low technical overhead for maintenance

**Output:**

[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]
After evaluating five potential CRM solutions for Community Care Coalition&#x27;s client tracking needs, we recommend CaseWorthy as the primary solution, with Social Solutions ETO as a strong alternative. CaseWorthy offers the best balance of human services-specific features, grant reporting capabilities, and implementation support within the $8,000 budget constraint. The solution will enable standardized client data collection, outcome tracking, and automated reporting that will save approximately 15 hours per month in manual data processing while improving grant compliance.

[ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT]
Community Care Coalition&#x27;s mission to provide housing support services requires robust client tracking to demonstrate program effectiveness and maintain grant compliance. The current spreadsheet system creates reporting challenges, data inconsistencies, and limited visibility into program outcomes. Key stakeholders include case managers needing simple data entry, program managers requiring outcome reports, and executive leadership needing grant compliance documentation.

[EVALUATION METHODOLOGY]
We weighted evaluation criteria based on Community Care Coalition&#x27;s specific needs, with highest priority given to grant reporting capabilities (25%), implementation simplicity (20%), and total cost of ownership (20%). We researched five potential solutions: CaseWorthy, Social Solutions ETO, ClientTrack, Apricot, and Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud. Information was gathered through vendor demonstrations, pricing quotes, nonprofit user reviews, and feature documentation.

[SOLUTION COMPARISON]
| Feature | CaseWorthy | Social Solutions | ClientTrack | Apricot | Salesforce |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|------------|

| Housing services templates | Excellent | Excellent | Good | Limited | Requires customization |
| Grant reporting | Built-in | Built-in | Basic | Custom | Requires add-ons |
| Implementation time | 4-6 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 3-4 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 8-12+ weeks |
| Training required | Moderate | Extensive | Moderate | Minimal | Extensive |

CaseWorthy and Social Solutions offer the most comprehensive human services features but differ in implementation complexity and cost. ClientTrack and Apricot are more affordable but offer fewer specialized features. Salesforce provides the most customization potential but exceeds budget and requires significant technical resources.

[RECOMMENDATION AND RATIONALE]
We recommend CaseWorthy as the optimal solution for Community Care Coalition based on:
1. Purpose-built features for housing services case management
2. Comprehensive outcome tracking aligned with common grant requirements
3. Implementation support package that includes data migration from spreadsheets
4. First-year costs within budget at $7,800 (including training)
5. Positive references from three similar-sized housing services nonprofits

If budget constraints tighten, Apricot provides a viable alternative at $5,400, though with more limited housing-specific features and reporting capabilities.

[RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION]
Primary implementation risks include:
1. Data migration complexity from unstructured spreadsheets
   - Mitigation: Allocate 3-4 weeks for data cleaning before migration
2. Staff adoption resistance
   - Mitigation: Identify 2-3 &quot;super users&quot; for peer training support
3. Reporting customization needs
   - Mitigation: Budget for 10 hours of post-implementation consulting

[NEXT STEPS]
1. Schedule demonstrations with top two vendors (CaseWorthy and Social Solutions)
2. Request references from similar housing services organizations
3. Begin data cleaning and standardization in current spreadsheets
4. Develop implementation timeline aligned with quarterly reporting cycle
5. Identify internal project lead and super users for training
