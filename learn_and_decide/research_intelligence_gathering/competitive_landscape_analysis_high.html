&lt;CONSTRAINTS&gt;
### Dos:
1. **Do** maintain a collaborative mindset, recognizing that nonprofits often benefit from partnership rather than pure competition
2. **Do** cite specific sources for all key information and data points
3. **Do** consider both quantitative metrics (budget size, people served) and qualitative factors (approach, values, reputation)
4. **Do** acknowledge information gaps and areas where assumptions were made
5. **Do** balance competitive analysis with opportunity identification
6. **Do** consider the full ecosystem including funders, partners, and policy environment
7. **Do** analyze trends over time, not just current snapshot
8. **Do** consider the perspective of beneficiaries/clients when evaluating services
9. **Do** include practical, actionable recommendations tied to [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s capacity
10. **Do** maintain ethical standards by using publicly available information

### Don&#x27;ts:
1. **Don&#x27;t** focus exclusively on competition without considering collaboration opportunities
2. **Don&#x27;t** make unfounded claims about other organizations&#x27; effectiveness
3. **Don&#x27;t** recommend strategies that contradict [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s mission or values
4. **Don&#x27;t** suggest unrealistic approaches given [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s resources
5. **Don&#x27;t** overlook smaller or newer organizations that might be innovative
6. **Don&#x27;t** focus solely on direct service competitors while ignoring policy/advocacy players
7. **Don&#x27;t** make recommendations without considering implementation feasibility
8. **Don&#x27;t** use outdated information without acknowledging its limitations
9. **Don&#x27;t** apply for-profit competitive analysis frameworks without adaptation to nonprofit context
10. **Don&#x27;t** overlook the importance of mission alignment in strategic recommendations
&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
Nonprofit competitive landscape analysis differs from corporate competitive analysis in several important ways:

1. **Mission-Driven Context**: Nonprofits measure success by mission impact, not just market share or financial metrics.

2. **Coopetition Dynamic**: Nonprofits often simultaneously compete (for funding, visibility) and collaborate (for impact).

3. **Multiple Stakeholders**: Analysis must consider diverse stakeholders including beneficiaries, donors, volunteers, staff, and community.

4. **Resource Constraints**: Most nonprofits operate with limited resources for research and analysis.

5. **Data Limitations**: Nonprofit sector often has less standardized data and fewer comprehensive databases.

6. **Impact Measurement Challenges**: Comparing effectiveness across organizations is complex due to varying impact metrics.

7. **Funding Complexity**: Understanding the funding landscape is critical as it shapes organizational behavior.

8. **Policy Environment**: Government policies and regulations often significantly impact nonprofit operations.

9. **Value of Differentiation**: Clear positioning helps with fundraising, volunteer recruitment, and beneficiary engagement.

10. **Strategic Partnerships**: Identifying collaboration opportunities is as important as competitive positioning.
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
### Example #1: Community Health Clinic

**Input:**
We need a competitive landscape analysis for Community Health Partners, a nonprofit clinic providing primary care services to uninsured and underinsured residents in the Greater Portland area. We&#x27;re considering expanding our mental health services and want to understand what other organizations are doing, where the gaps are, and how we might position ourselves. Our annual budget is $2.3M and we serve approximately 4,500 patients annually.

**Thoughts:**
This analysis needs to focus on:
- Other healthcare providers serving similar populations
- Specific mental health service providers in the area
- Funding sources for mental health services
- Gaps in current mental health provision
- Unique positioning opportunities

I&#x27;ll need to research:
- Federally Qualified Health Centers in the region
- Hospital-based charity care programs
- Free/sliding scale mental health providers
- County health department services
- Telehealth mental health providers
- Grant opportunities specific to mental health

**Output Excerpt:**

## 1. Executive Summary
Community Health Partners operates in a complex healthcare landscape with 7 other major providers serving uninsured/underinsured populations in Greater Portland. Mental health services for this population show significant gaps, particularly in trauma-informed care, culturally specific services, and integrated behavioral health. CHP has opportunities to differentiate through Spanish-language services, extended hours, and care coordination that competitors currently lack.

## 3. Competitive Landscape Overview
The Greater Portland safety-net healthcare ecosystem includes:
- 2 Federally Qualified Health Centers (Outside In, Virginia Garcia)
- 3 Hospital-based charity care programs (Providence, Legacy, OHSU)
- 1 County health department with 3 clinic locations
- 4 Specialized free clinics (dental, vision, etc.)
- 8 Mental health providers with sliding scale options

Mental health service provision is particularly fragmented, with long waitlists (3-6 months) for most affordable services. Only 2 providers offer integrated physical/mental healthcare, and only 1 offers services in languages other than English.

## 4. Detailed Competitor Profiles
**Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center**
- Mission alignment: High (focuses on culturally responsive care)
- Programs: Primary care, dental, pharmacy, some mental health
- Target population: Primarily Latino/Hispanic communities
- Geographic footprint: 6 clinics across Washington and Yamhill counties
- Size: $35M budget, 25,000 patients annually
- Funding: FQHC funding, Medicaid, grants, donations
- Unique strengths: Cultural competency, integrated care model
- Collaboration potential: High (possible partnership for specialized services)

## 5. Gap Analysis
Mental health service gaps include:
- Immediate/crisis services (current wait times 3+ weeks)
- Evening/weekend appointments (all providers operate standard business hours)
- Culturally specific trauma services for immigrant populations
- Integrated substance use and mental health treatment
- Services for uninsured patients who don&#x27;t qualify for OHP
- Transportation support to access appointments

## 8. Strategic Recommendations
1. **Differentiation Strategy**: Position as the only provider offering same-day mental health consultations integrated with primary care
2. **Partnership Opportunity**: Develop formal referral relationship with Virginia Garcia for Spanish-speaking patients needing specialized mental health services
3. **Program Innovation**: Implement evening mental health hours (4-8pm) twice weekly to serve working patients
4. **Funding Approach**: Target HRSA Integrated Behavioral Health Services grant in next cycle (applications due October)
5. **Implementation Consideration**: Begin with part-time mental health staff and telehealth options to test demand before full-scale implementation

### Example #2: Youth Mentoring Organization

**Input:**
Our organization, Future Leaders Mentoring, pairs adult volunteers with at-risk youth ages 10-18 in Chicago&#x27;s South Side. We currently serve about 75 youth annually with a budget of $350,000. We&#x27;re trying to understand the mentoring landscape in Chicago to identify our unique niche and potential growth areas. We&#x27;re particularly interested in understanding what other organizations are doing with career-focused mentoring.

**Thoughts:**
This analysis should focus on:
- Other youth mentoring organizations in Chicago
- Programs specifically serving South Side communities
- Career development programs for similar youth populations
- Funding sources for youth mentoring programs
- Potential partnership opportunities

I need to research:
- Big Brothers Big Sisters of Metropolitan Chicago
- Local mentoring programs operated by schools/churches
- Career development programs for youth
- Corporate mentoring initiatives
- Foundation funding for youth development

**Output Excerpt:**

## 1. Executive Summary
Future Leaders Mentoring operates in a youth development landscape with 12 identified organizations providing mentoring services in Chicago, 5 of which serve the South Side. Career-focused mentoring represents an underserved niche, with only 2 organizations offering structured career exposure programs. FLM has opportunities to differentiate through industry-specific mentoring tracks, longer-term mentoring relationships (beyond high school), and deeper parental engagement than competitors currently provide.

## 3. Competitive Landscape Overview
Chicago&#x27;s youth mentoring ecosystem includes:
- 1 National organization with local chapter (Big Brothers Big Sisters)
- 4 Chicago-specific mentoring organizations
- 7 Youth development organizations with mentoring components
- 3 School-based mentoring programs
- 5 Career/workforce development programs for teens

The South Side is served by 5 organizations, but program capacity meets only approximately 15% of estimated need based on youth population statistics.

## 7. SWOT Analysis for Future Leaders Mentoring
**Strengths:**
- Higher mentor retention rate (18 months vs. industry average 10 months)
- Strong relationships with 3 South Side schools
- More diverse mentor pool than larger organizations

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited staff capacity (3 FTE vs. 8-12 at larger organizations)
- Lack of formal evaluation framework
- Limited corporate partnerships

**Opportunities:**
- Growing corporate interest in South Side investment
- Untapped funding from workforce development grants
- Potential school partnerships for in-school programming

**Threats:**
- Big Brothers Big Sisters expanding South Side presence
- Declining foundation funding for mentoring programs
- Increasing background check requirements raising volunteer barriers

## 8. Strategic Recommendations
1. **Differentiation Strategy**: Develop industry-specific mentoring tracks (healthcare, technology, trades, entrepreneurship) that connect youth with professionals in growth sectors
2. **Partnership Opportunity**: Establish formal collaboration with South Side Workforce Center to create mentoring-to-internship pipeline
3. **Program Innovation**: Implement &quot;Mentor Families&quot; approach pairing youth with both a primary mentor and access to the mentor&#x27;s professional network
4. **Funding Approach**: Target Chicago&#x27;s Youth Employment Fund and corporate sponsorships from companies seeking to develop South Side talent pipeline
5. **Implementation Consideration**: Begin with pilot program focusing on two industries with strongest current mentor representation
&lt;/FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;

&lt;RECAP&gt;
