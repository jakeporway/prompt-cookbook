&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
Policy analysis for nonprofits differs from corporate or academic analysis in several important ways:

1. **Mission-Centric Lens**: Nonprofits evaluate policy through the lens of mission advancement and community impact, not profit or purely academic interest.

2. **Resource Constraints**: Most nonprofits have limited capacity for policy monitoring and response, requiring focused, efficient analysis.

3. **Stakeholder Complexity**: Nonprofits must consider impacts across diverse stakeholders including beneficiaries, funders, partners, and communities.

4. **Advocacy Considerations**: Many nonprofits engage in advocacy within legal constraints, requiring nuanced understanding of lobbying rules and advocacy tactics.

5. **Funding Implications**: Policy changes often directly affect nonprofit funding streams, requiring financial impact assessment.

6. **Cross-Sector Perspective**: Effective nonprofit policy analysis considers public, private, and nonprofit sector interactions.

7. **Values Alignment**: Policy recommendations must align with organizational values and ethical commitments.

8. **Community Voice Integration**: Authentic policy analysis incorporates the perspectives of affected communities.
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
### Example #1: Environmental Nonprofit Policy Analysis

## Usage Instructions

This template is designed for nonprofit organizations needing to understand and respond to policy changes affecting their work. For optimal results:

1. **Recommended Model**: Use ChatGPT-o3 for this analysis due to its enhanced reasoning capabilities and ability to synthesize complex policy information.

   - Replace [ORGANIZATION_NAME] with your nonprofit&#x27;s name
   - Replace [POLICY_AREA] with your specific policy domain (healthcare, education, environment, etc.)
   - Provide information about your organization&#x27;s mission, programs, and stakeholders
   - Include specific policy questions or concerns
   - Share relevant information sources (reports, articles, legislation)

3. **Customization Tips**:
   - For smaller organizations: Focus the analysis on 1-2 key policy areas most critical to your work
   - For coalitions: Expand stakeholder analysis to include member organizations

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If analysis is too broad: Provide more specific policy questions and organizational context
   - If recommendations seem unrealistic: Clarify your resource constraints and organizational capacity
   - If output lacks depth in critical areas: Request a follow-up analysis focusing on those specific aspects

5. **Follow-up Prompts**:
   - &quot;Expand on the implications of [specific policy trend] for our [specific program]&quot;
