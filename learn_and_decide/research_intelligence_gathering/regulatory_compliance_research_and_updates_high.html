Your research summary will be organized in the following comprehensive format:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
   - Brief overview of the compliance question investigated
   - Key findings and critical compliance requirements
   - Highest priority action items with timeframes
   - Notable risks or special considerations

2. **REGULATORY LANDSCAPE**
   - Relevant regulatory frameworks and governing bodies
   - Jurisdiction-specific requirements (Federal/State/Local)
   - Recent or upcoming regulatory changes affecting [ORGANIZATION_NAME]
   - Nonprofit-specific provisions or exemptions

3. **DETAILED COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS**
   - Categorized requirements with implementation guidance
   - Documentation and reporting obligations
   - Timeline of compliance deadlines and milestones

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
**Example #1: Data Privacy Compliance Research**

**Input:**
Our education nonprofit [YOUTH_LEARNING_ALLIANCE] needs to understand what data privacy regulations apply to our after-school tutoring program that collects student information. We operate in California and receive some federal education funding. Please research applicable regulations including FERPA, COPPA, and California-specific requirements.

**Thoughts:**
This requires research on multiple regulatory frameworks:
1. Federal education privacy law (FERPA) 
2. Children&#x27;s online privacy (COPPA)
3. California-specific privacy laws (CCPA/CPRA)
4. How these intersect for nonprofits with partial federal funding
5. Specific requirements for educational program data

**Output:**

# REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RESEARCH: YOUTH DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Youth Learning Alliance must comply with multiple overlapping data privacy regulations due to your work with minors, educational focus, and California location. Key findings include:

* **FERPA Applicability**: As a recipient of federal education funding, you must protect student educational records with specific consent requirements
* **COPPA Requirements**: For any online services directed to children under 13, verifiable parental consent is mandatory
* **California-Specific Obligations**: CCPA/CPRA creates additional rights for California residents, though nonprofits have limited exemptions
* **Highest Priority Actions**: Implement comprehensive data inventory, develop consent mechanisms, establish data security protocols

## REGULATORY LANDSCAPE
* **Federal Educational Privacy Framework**
  * Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) - 20 U.S.C. ¬ß 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99
  * Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) - 20 U.S.C. ¬ß 1232h; 34 CFR Part 98
  * Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) - 15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 6501-6506

* **California Privacy Framework**
  * California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
  * California Education Code privacy provisions
  * Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA)

* **Recent Changes**
  * CPRA amendments effective January 1, 2023, expanding consumer rights
  * Department of Education guidance on virtual learning privacy (March 2021)

* **Nonprofit-Specific Provisions**
  * Partial CCPA exemption for nonprofits (revenue thresholds apply)
  * FERPA application to nonprofits receiving Department of Education funds

**Example #2: Charitable Registration Compliance Research**

**Input:**
[GLOBAL_RELIEF_NETWORK] is expanding our fundraising to include online donations from supporters nationwide. We&#x27;re currently registered in our home state of New York. Please research which states require charitable solicitation registration for nonprofits accepting online donations and the process for multi-state compliance.

**Thoughts:**
This requires research on:
1. State-by-state charitable solicitation requirements
2. How online fundraising affects registration obligations
3. Multi-state registration processes and exemptions
4. Nonprofit-specific considerations and thresholds
5. Ongoing compliance requirements

**Output:**

# REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RESEARCH: MULTI-STATE CHARITABLE SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Global Relief Network faces complex multi-state registration requirements when accepting online donations nationwide. Key findings include:

* **Registration Requirement**: 41 states plus DC require charitable registration for organizations soliciting donations from their residents
* **Online Fundraising Impact**: Most states consider a donation-enabled website accessible to their residents as solicitation within their jurisdiction
* **Charleston Principles**: Some states follow these guidelines, which may exempt organizations without state-specific targeting
* **Highest Priority Actions**: Implement unified registration service, develop state-specific disclosures, establish renewal tracking system
