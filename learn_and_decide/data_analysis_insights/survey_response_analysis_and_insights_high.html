&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
### Nonprofit Survey Analysis Context
- Nonprofits often collect survey data from multiple stakeholder groups (beneficiaries, donors, volunteers, staff, community members)
- Survey data helps demonstrate program effectiveness to funders and board members
- Resource constraints may limit the sophistication of data collection methods
- Qualitative feedback is often as valuable as quantitative metrics in the nonprofit context
- Survey insights should ultimately connect to advancing the organization&#x27;s mission
- Nonprofit surveys often need to balance impact measurement with stakeholder experience
- Data may need to be analyzed through an equity lens to ensure all voices are represented
- Insights should consider both immediate program improvements and long-term strategic direction
- Recommendations must be practical given typical nonprofit staffing and budget limitations
- Survey analysis may inform grant applications, annual reports, and strategic planning
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
### Example #1: Community Food Bank Volunteer Satisfaction Survey

&lt;RECAP&gt;
To effectively analyze survey data for [ORGANIZATION_NAME], I will:

1. Thoroughly review both quantitative and qualitative survey data
2. Identify key patterns across different stakeholder segments
3. Extract 3-5 strategic insights directly connected to your mission
4. Develop practical, resource-conscious recommendations
5. Present findings in a clear, actionable format with an executive summary, detailed analysis, and prioritized recommendations

Remember to:
- Provide the complete survey data in your initial prompt
- Specify your [MISSION_STATEMENT] and [TARGET_AUDIENCE]
- Note any specific strategic questions you want the analysis to address
- Mention any previous survey results for comparison
- Include any resource constraints that might affect recommendation implementation

This template is designed for ChatGPT-o3 to provide the deepest analytical insights, though ChatGPT-4o will also work effectively. For large datasets, consider breaking the analysis into multiple sessions or focusing on specific segments or questions in each prompt.
&lt;/RECAP&gt;

## Usage Instructions

### When to Use This Template
- After conducting stakeholder surveys (beneficiary feedback, donor satisfaction, volunteer experience, etc.)
- When evaluating program effectiveness or participant outcomes
- For annual community needs assessments
- To analyze feedback from events, workshops, or training sessions
- When preparing for strategic planning or board presentations

### Required Inputs
1. Complete survey data (quantitative and qualitative responses)
2. Your organization&#x27;s mission statement
3. Target audience information
4. Specific analysis objectives or strategic questions
5. Any previous survey results for comparison (if available)

### Customization Tips
- Replace [ORGANIZATION_NAME], [PROGRAM_NAME], [MISSION_STATEMENT], and [TARGET_AUDIENCE] with your specific information
- Adjust the demographic segments in the output format to match your survey respondents
- Add specific strategic questions unique to your organization&#x27;s current challenges
- Modify the output format to match your internal reporting requirements
- For very large surveys, consider breaking analysis into multiple segments (e.g., by stakeholder type)

### Best Practices
- Provide complete survey data rather than summaries for the most accurate analysis
- Include both quantitative (ratings, multiple choice) and qualitative (open-ended) responses
- Be specific about what decisions the survey insights will inform
- Consider using ChatGPT-o3 for more nuanced analysis of complex qualitative responses
- Review recommendations for feasibility before implementation

### Troubleshooting
- If recommendations seem too generic: Provide more context about your organization&#x27;s specific constraints and strategic priorities
- If analysis lacks depth: Ensure you&#x27;ve included all qualitative responses and demographic data
- If outputs are too lengthy: Request a condensed executive summary version
- If certain stakeholder groups seem overlooked: Specifically request analysis of those segments.</pre>
