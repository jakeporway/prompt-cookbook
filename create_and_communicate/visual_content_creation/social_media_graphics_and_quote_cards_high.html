&lt;/OUTPUT&gt;

&lt;CONSTRAINTS&gt;
**Dos:**
1. DO maintain alignment with [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s mission and values in all visual elements
2. DO prioritize readability and clarity of message over decorative elements
3. DO recommend accessible color combinations with sufficient contrast
4. DO create designs that work well when scaled down on mobile devices

2. DON&#x27;T recommend visuals that could be perceived as exploitative of beneficiaries
3. DON&#x27;T create cluttered layouts with too many competing elements

&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
Nonprofits face unique challenges when creating visual content:

1. **Resource Limitations:** Many nonprofits have limited design budgets and staff capacity, requiring solutions that can be implemented with basic tools like Canva.

2. **Stakeholder Sensitivity:** Visual representation of beneficiaries, communities, and sensitive issues requires careful consideration to avoid exploitation or stereotyping.

3. **Brand Consistency:** Maintaining consistent visual identity across volunteer-created content can be challenging but is essential for recognition.

4. **Impact Communication:** Effectively communicating complex impact data or emotional stories through simple visuals requires strategic design thinking.

5. **Multi-Channel Needs:** Nonprofits often need to reach diverse audiences across multiple platforms with limited resources to create platform-specific content.

6. **Accessibility Requirements:** Many nonprofits serve diverse populations with varying abilities, making accessibility a core requirement rather than an afterthought.

7. **Call-to-Action Focus:** Nonprofit visuals often need to drive specific actions (donate, volunteer, advocate) while maintaining mission focus.
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;

&lt;FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;
**Example #1: Impact Statistic Graphic**

**Input:**
We need a graphic highlighting that our food bank [FOOD_SECURITY_NONPROFIT] distributed 250,000 meals to families in need last year. Our colors are navy blue (#0A3161) and orange (#FF8C42). Target platform is Instagram. We want to convey both impact and urgency for continued support.

**Thoughts:**
This graphic needs to balance the celebration of impact with the ongoing need. A food-related visual that shows abundance rather than scarcity would be more positive. The statistic should be the focal point, with supporting text providing context. Instagram square format works best with a clean, bold design.

**Output:**

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Core message: Significant impact (250,000 meals) with implied need for continued support
   - Target audience: Instagram users, potential donors and volunteers
   - Platform: Instagram square format (1080x1080px)
   - Goal: Generate appreciation for impact while motivating continued support

2. **Visual Concept**
   - DALL-E prompt: &quot;A minimalist, hopeful illustration of diverse food items arranged in a circular pattern on a navy blue background, stylized and simplified, warm lighting, no text, suitable for a food bank social media graphic, professional, clean design&quot;
   - Style description: Clean, bold, optimistic with professional appearance
   - Color palette: Primary: Navy #0A3161, Orange #FF8C42; Secondary: White #FFFFFF, Light blue #D6E4F0
   - Layout: Circular food illustration as background element, large central statistic, organization logo at bottom

3. **Text Treatment**
   - Main message: &quot;250,000 MEALS&quot; in large, bold sans-serif font (70-80% of image width)
   - Secondary text: &quot;Distributed to families in 2023&quot; in smaller font below
   - Tertiary text: &quot;Help us reach even more in 2024&quot; as call-to-action
   - Font pairing: Bold sans-serif for numbers, lighter weight for supporting text

4. **Platform Variations**
   - Instagram: 1080x1080px square with full graphic
   - Instagram Story: 1080x1920px vertical adaptation with more space above/below
   - Facebook: 1200x630px with elements rearranged horizontally
   - Twitter: 1600x900px with condensed layout

5. **Accessibility Features**
   - Color contrast: Navy background with white text (7:1 ratio), orange elements as accents only
   - Alt text: &quot;Infographic showing 250,000 meals distributed by [FOOD_SECURITY_NONPROFIT] to families in need during 2023, with a call to support future efforts.&quot;
   - Simplified version: Text-focused version without background illustration
   - Readability: Minimum 24pt font size for all text elements

6. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Canva implementation: Use Shapes tool for color blocks, Elements for simple food icons if illustration unavailable
   - Quality check: Ensure text is legible when viewed at thumbnail size
   - File format: PNG for posting, save layered file for future modifications
   - Variations: Create a template that can be updated with new statistics quarterly

**Example #2: Quote Card from Program Participant**

**Input:**
We need a quote card featuring this testimonial from Maria, a participant in our [YOUTH_MENTORSHIP_PROGRAM]: &quot;This program didn&#x27;t just teach me skills ‚Äì it showed me possibilities I never imagined for my future.&quot; Our brand colors are teal (#008080) and purple (#5D3FD3). This will be shared on LinkedIn and Facebook to attract potential mentors.

**Thoughts:**
This testimonial focuses on transformation and possibility, so the visual should convey growth, horizons, or new perspectives. Since it&#x27;s targeting potential mentors on professional platforms, the design should be inspirational but professional. The quote is powerful and should be the central focus.

**Output:**

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Core message: Personal transformation through mentorship
   - Target audience: Potential mentors, professional audience
   - Platforms: LinkedIn and Facebook
   - Goal: Inspire professionals to volunteer as mentors

2. **Visual Concept**
   - DALL-E prompt: &quot;A professional, hopeful image showing a gradient sunrise or horizon in teal and purple tones, minimalist style, abstract, suitable as background for an inspirational quote, clean design with space for text overlay&quot;
   - Style description: Professional, hopeful, forward-looking with gradient elements
   - Color palette: Primary: Teal #008080, Purple #5D3FD3; Secondary: White #FFFFFF, Light teal #B4D8D8

   - Optional subtitle: &quot;Join our mentor team at [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&quot; with website

   - Facebook: 1200x630px (nearly identical to LinkedIn)
   - Additional square format: 1080x1080px for potential Instagram use
   - Text-only version for Twitter with link to full graphic

5. **Accessibility Features**
   - Color contrast: Ensure text has 4.5:1 contrast ratio against background gradient
   - Alt text: &quot;Quote from Maria, a [YOUTH_MENTORSHIP_PROGRAM] participant, stating: &#x27;This program didn&#x27;t just teach me skills ‚Äì it showed me possibilities I never imagined for my future.&#x27;&quot;
   - Simplified version: Solid color background option if gradient causes readability issues
   - Readability: Test text visibility against all areas of gradient background

6. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Canva implementation: Use gradient background feature, frame the quote with quotation marks
   - Quality check: Ensure attribution is clear but subordinate to main quote
   - File format: PNG for posting, save template for future testimonials
   - Series potential: Create a consistent template for a &quot;Voices of Impact&quot; series featuring different participants
&lt;/FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES&gt;

&lt;RECAP&gt;
When creating social media graphics and quote cards for [ORGANIZATION_NAME], remember these key principles:

1. **Mission Alignment:** Every visual element should reinforce your nonprofit&#x27;s mission and values while maintaining brand consistency.

2. **Audience Focus:** Design with your specific audience segments in mind, considering their preferences, platform usage, and what will motivate them to engage.

3. **Accessibility First:** Build accessibility into the design process from the beginning with appropriate contrast, text size, and alternative formats.

4. **Resource-Conscious Design:** Create templates and systems that can be easily implemented with limited design resources or expertise.

5. **Platform Optimization:** Adapt designs for each platform&#x27;s specific requirements while maintaining consistent branding and messaging.

6. **Ethical Visualization:** Ensure all representations of communities, beneficiaries, and issues are respectful, empowering, and non-exploitative.

7. **Measurable Impact:** Design graphics with clear calls-to-action that can be tracked and measured for effectiveness.

For best results, provide as much specific information as possible about your organization&#x27;s brand guidelines, target audience, and the specific message you want to communicate. The more context you provide, the more tailored and effective your visual content will be.

Use this template repeatedly to create a consistent library of visual assets that can be deployed across campaigns and platforms while maintaining a cohesive visual identity.
