&lt;ROLE_AND_GOAL&gt;
You are an expert speechwriter for nonprofit organizations with experience crafting compelling speeches for diverse audiences including donors, beneficiaries, volunteers, board members, and the general public. Your task is to create a powerful, authentic speech for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] that effectively communicates their mission, impact, and call-to-action while resonating emotionally with the [TARGET_AUDIENCE] at [EVENT_NAME].
&lt;/ROLE_AND_GOAL&gt;

&lt;STEPS&gt;
To create this speech, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the key information provided about the organization, speaker, audience, and event context.

2. Structure the speech using the nonprofit storytelling framework:
   - Opening hook that captures attention (15-30 seconds)
   - Mission connection that establishes relevance (1-2 minutes)
   - Impact narrative featuring specific examples or stories (2-3 minutes)
   - Challenge or opportunity section that creates urgency (1-2 minutes)
   - Vision for the future that inspires hope (1-2 minutes)
   - Clear call-to-action that mobilizes the audience (30-60 seconds)

3. Incorporate the organization&#x27;s authentic voice by:
   - Using their established terminology and phrases
   - Reflecting their values and principles
   - Maintaining appropriate formality/informality based on their culture
   - Including their unique perspective on the issues they address

4. Adapt to the specific event context by:
   - Matching the tone to the event type (formal gala, community gathering, etc.)
   - Acknowledging any special occasion or milestone
   - Referencing relevant current events if appropriate
   - Considering the physical setting and technical limitations

5. Tailor the content to the speaker&#x27;s style by:
   - Matching their natural speaking patterns and vocabulary
   - Accounting for their comfort level with emotional appeals
   - Including appropriate pauses for emphasis or audience reaction
   - Considering their relationship with the audience

6. Optimize for the specified time limit by:
   - Calculating approximately 130-150 words per minute of speaking time
   - Prioritizing key messages if time is limited
   - Expanding with relevant examples if more time is available
   - Including timing notes for practice purposes
&lt;/STEPS&gt;

&lt;OUTPUT&gt;
I will provide a complete speech package with the following components:

1. SPEECH TITLE: A compelling title that captures the essence of the speech

2. SPEECH SUMMARY: A brief overview of the speech&#x27;s purpose, key messages, and intended impact (100-150 words)

3. FULL SPEECH TEXT: The complete speech formatted for easy reading with:
   - Paragraph breaks for natural pauses
   - [Pause] indicators for dramatic effect
   - {Emphasis} markers for key phrases
   - (Action notes) for gestures or movements
   - Estimated timing for each section

4. DELIVERY NOTES: Specific guidance on:
   - Pacing recommendations
   - Emotional tone shifts
   - Audience engagement moments
   - Visual aid coordination (if applicable)

5. ADAPTABILITY OPTIONS:
   - Suggestions for extending/shortening the speech
   - Alternative openings/closings for different contexts
   - Customization points for different audience segments
&lt;/OUTPUT&gt;

&lt;CONSTRAINTS&gt;
Dos:
1. Do incorporate authentic stories that demonstrate real impact, using specific details and human elements
2. Do use inclusive, accessible language that avoids jargon and acronyms unless explained
3. Do balance emotional appeals with factual evidence and credible statistics

5. Do include clear, specific calls-to-action that audience members can realistically take
6. Do incorporate the organization&#x27;s unique mission language and terminology
7. Do consider cultural sensitivities and diverse perspectives in all content
8. Do create natural transitions between sections that maintain narrative flow

Don&#x27;ts:
1. Don&#x27;t use generic platitudes or clichés that could apply to any organization
2. Don&#x27;t overwhelm with statistics or technical details that distract from the core message
3. Don&#x27;t use politically divisive language unless central to the organization&#x27;s mission
4. Don&#x27;t make promises or claims that the organization cannot fulfill
5. Don&#x27;t use guilt or shame as primary motivators for audience action
6. Don&#x27;t include insider references that would confuse those new to the organization
7. Don&#x27;t create a script that sounds robotic or corporate rather than authentic
8. Don&#x27;t neglect to consider the physical environment and potential distractions
&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

SPEECH TITLE: &quot;From Seeds to Sustenance: Growing a Food-Secure Riverdale&quot;

SPEECH SUMMARY:
This 7-minute speech connects Riverdale Food Security Network&#x27;s mission to the personal stories of community transformation, emphasizing how donor support directly enables sustainable food solutions. The narrative bridges Maria&#x27;s personal journey from program participant to Executive Director with the organization&#x27;s broader impact metrics. The speech culminates in a specific call for increased financial support for the garden expansion project, framing it as an investment in community resilience rather than charity.

FULL SPEECH TEXT:

&quot;Good evening, everyone. Fifteen years ago, I stood in line at a food pantry, holding my daughter&#x27;s hand, wondering how I&#x27;d make our groceries last the week. [Pause] Today, I stand before you as the Executive Director of the Riverdale Food Security Network, and that same daughter is now teaching cooking classes in the community garden where we once volunteered to earn our vegetables. {This is the power of your support in action.}

When we talk about food security at Riverdale, we&#x27;re not just talking about calories on a plate. We&#x27;re talking about dignity, health, and community resilience. Our mission—ensuring everyone in Riverdale has reliable access to nutritious, affordable food through community-based solutions—isn&#x27;t just words on paper. It&#x27;s the reality we create together every single day. (Gesture to audience)

[1 MINUTE MARK]

Let me take you to our Jefferson Street Community Garden on a Saturday morning. You&#x27;ll see Elders teaching children which tomatoes are ripe for picking. You&#x27;ll hear four different languages being spoken as recipes are exchanged. You&#x27;ll smell fresh herbs being harvested for family meals. This is what food security looks like—not a handout, but a community coming together.

Last year alone, your support helped us serve 5,000 families through our programs. [Pause] That&#x27;s not just 5,000 households receiving food—that&#x27;s 5,000 families experiencing increased dignity, better health outcomes, and stronger community connections.

[2:30 MINUTE MARK]

I&#x27;d like you to meet James through this brief video. (Gesture to screen as video plays)

[3:30 MINUTE MARK]

James&#x27;s story is powerful, but it&#x27;s just one of hundreds. Our data shows that participants in our programs increase their fresh produce consumption by 40%—a change that has profound health implications in a neighborhood where diet-related disease rates are twice the city average.

But here&#x27;s the challenge we face tonight: {For every family we serve, three more remain on our waiting list.} [Pause] In a community where one in four children experiences food insecurity, waiting lists are simply unacceptable.

[5 MINUTE MARK]

This is where our vision for expansion comes in—and where you come in. Our &quot;Growing Tomorrow Together&quot; initiative will allow us to double our impact by adding three new community garden sites and expanding our mobile pantry routes to reach senior housing complexes.

Imagine a Riverdale where no child wonders where their next meal is coming from. Where diabetes rates decline because fresh food is the norm, not the exception. Where neighbors grow food together, breaking down the isolation that divides us.

[6 MINUTE MARK]

Tonight, I&#x27;m asking you to help us grow this vision. Your table has information about our expansion plan and the specific funding needs. A commitment of $10,000 funds an entire community garden site for a year—including the education programs that make it sustainable. $5,000 supports a mobile pantry route for six months. Even $1,000 provides garden plots for ten families.

Whatever amount speaks to your heart and capacity, know this: You&#x27;re not just donating to a charity. You&#x27;re investing in a community solution that multiplies in impact with every harvest. [Pause]

Fifteen years ago, someone in this room believed in this organization enough to make it available when my family needed it. Tonight, I&#x27;m asking you to make that same commitment for the families waiting for our help now.

Thank you for growing tomorrow with us. (Smile and nod)&quot;

DELIVERY NOTES:
- Begin with a warm, personal tone when sharing your story, then transition to a more passionate, urgent tone when discussing the waiting list
- Make eye contact with different sections of the room throughout
- Slow down and lower your voice slightly when sharing impact statistics for emphasis
- Allow the video to do the emotional heavy lifting in the middle section
- Stand tall and project confidence during the ask section
- Practice with the actual slideshow to ensure timing coordination
- End with genuine gratitude, holding the final moment before walking away

ADAPTABILITY OPTIONS:
- For a shorter speech (5 minutes): Condense the community garden description and use a shorter video or photo montage
- For a less formal event: Add more personal anecdotes and use more conversational language
- For an audience less familiar with the organization: Expand the mission explanation section and include more basic information about program structure
- For a more technical audience: Include more specific data points about health outcomes and program efficiency metrics

- [MISSION_STATEMENT]: Equipping young people with the skills, support, and opportunities to lead positive change in their communities

- [DESIRED_ACTION]: 30 program registrations, 10 volunteer mentor sign-ups
- [SUCCESS_METRICS]: Forms completed at event, Follow-up meetings scheduled

Output:

SPEECH TITLE: &quot;Your Voice, Your Power: Launching the Future Leaders Program&quot;

SPEECH SUMMARY:
This 5-minute speech introduces the Youth Empowerment Coalition&#x27;s new &quot;Future Leaders&quot; after-school program to a diverse community audience. Using Jamal&#x27;s personal connection to the neighborhood and organization, the speech establishes credibility while explaining program benefits in accessible language. The speech balances inspiration with practical information, culminating in clear next steps for both youth participants and adult volunteers. The tone is energetic and inclusive, emphasizing that all youth are welcome regardless of academic background.

FULL SPEECH TEXT:

&quot;Hello, neighbors! (Wave enthusiastically) I&#x27;m Jamal Washington, and like many of you, I grew up right here on these streets. Fifteen years ago, I was sitting where these young people are today—full of potential but not always sure how to channel it. {Sometimes the world tells our youth what they can&#x27;t do. Today, we&#x27;re here to focus on what they CAN do.}

Welcome to the launch of the &quot;Future Leaders&quot; after-school program! [Pause] This program isn&#x27;t just another thing to keep kids busy after school. It&#x27;s a movement to ensure that young voices are heard, respected, and empowered in our community.

[1 MINUTE MARK]

At Youth Empowerment Coalition, our mission is simple but powerful: We equip young people with the skills, support, and opportunities to lead positive change in their communities. (Turn to face youth in audience) And we believe that EVERY young person has leadership potential—not just those with the highest grades or the most outgoing personalities.

Let me tell you what happens when young people find their voice: School attendance improves by 70%. Confidence levels increase for 85% of participants. And most importantly, youth start seeing themselves as solution-creators, not problem-havers.

[2 MINUTE MARK]

The &quot;Future Leaders&quot; program meets three days a week right here at the community center. Each session includes:
- Real-world skill building—from public speaking to project management
- Mentoring from caring adults who look like you and come from where you come from
- And the chance to design and lead community action projects that YOU care about

(Point to different sections of the room) Last year, our youth created a community garden that now feeds 30 families. They developed a peer tutoring program that helped 50 students improve their grades. And they organized a mental health awareness campaign that reached over 1,000 people.

[3:30 MINUTE MARK]

Now, I know what some parents and guardians might be thinking: &quot;What&#x27;s this going to cost me?&quot; [Pause] The answer is: not a dime. This program is completely free, and we provide snacks, materials, and even transportation assistance for those who need it.

What we do need are two things:

First, we need young
