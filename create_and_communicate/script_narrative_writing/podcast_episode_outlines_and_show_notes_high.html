### Don&#x27;ts:
1. **Avoid Jargon:** Don&#x27;t use sector-specific terminology without explanation

4. **Avoid Negativity:** Focus on solutions rather than just problems
5. **Avoid Complexity:** Keep show notes scannable and easy to digest

7. **Avoid Repetition:** Ensure each segment offers unique value and perspective
&lt;/CONSTRAINTS&gt;

&lt;CONTEXT&gt;
### Nonprofit Podcast Considerations:
- Nonprofit podcasts typically operate with limited production resources and staff time
- Episodes often need to serve multiple purposes: education, advocacy, fundraising, community building
- Content must balance compelling storytelling with clear organizational messaging
- Podcasts are a relationship-building tool that should deepen audience connection to the mission
- Show notes and social content are critical for extending reach beyond direct listeners
- Metrics of success include not just downloads but also conversion to donors, volunteers, or advocates

### Audience Engagement Factors:
- Nonprofit audiences typically want both emotional connection AND practical information
- Listeners may include current donors, potential donors, volunteers, beneficiaries, and peer organizations
- Content should be accessible to newcomers while still valuable to those familiar with the cause
- Different platforms (website, social media, podcast directories) may reach different audience segments
- Podcast content should complement other communication channels, not duplicate them

### Technical Considerations:
- Show notes should be optimized for SEO with relevant keywords and structured content
- Social media content should be platform-appropriate in length, tone, and format
- Timestamps improve accessibility and user experience
- Resource links should be trackable when possible (UTM parameters)
- Content should be easily repurposable for newsletters, annual reports, and grant applications
&lt;/CONTEXT&gt;
