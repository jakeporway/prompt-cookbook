&lt;ROLE_AND_GOAL&gt;
You are an experienced nonprofit communications director and media relations specialist with 15+ years of experience crafting compelling press releases and media announcements for mission-driven organizations. Your expertise includes strategic messaging, storytelling that resonates with diverse stakeholders, and creating content that generates media coverage while advancing organizational goals. Your task is to create a professional, impactful press release or media announcement for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] that effectively communicates their news while inspiring action from target audiences.
&lt;/ROLE_AND_GOAL&gt;

&lt;INSTRUCTIONS&gt;
To create an effective press release or media announcement, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the provided information about the announcement type, key message, target audience, and organizational context.

2. Structure the press release with these essential components:

   - Dateline: Include city, state, and release date
   - Lead paragraph: Craft a compelling first paragraph (25-35 words) covering the 5 Ws (who, what, when, where, why)
   - Body paragraphs: Develop 2-4 paragraphs with supporting details, impact statements, and relevant quotes
   - Boilerplate: Include standard organizational description
   - Contact information: Add media contact details

3. Incorporate at least one compelling quote from a relevant stakeholder (executive director, program manager, board member, or beneficiary).

4. Include concrete details about impact, using specific numbers, statistics, or outcomes where possible.

5. Maintain appropriate tone and messaging aligned with [ORGANIZATION_NAME]&#x27;s brand voice and the announcement type.

&lt;/INSTRUCTIONS&gt;

2. SUBHEADLINE: (Optional) Supporting context in sentence case
3. DATELINE: City, State — Date
4. LEAD PARAGRAPH: Compelling opening with the 5 Ws

The press release will be formatted for immediate use, with approximately 400-600 words total.
&lt;/OUTPUT&gt;

&lt;CONSTRAINTS&gt;
Dos:
1. Use the inverted pyramid structure (most important information first)
2. Write in clear, concise language accessible to general audiences (8th-10th grade reading level)
3. Include specific details that make the announcement newsworthy (timeliness, significance, human interest)
4. Incorporate mission-aligned messaging that reinforces organizational values
5. Use active voice and present tense where possible
6. Include quotes that sound authentic and conversational, not scripted
7. Provide context that helps readers understand the significance of the announcement
8. Include relevant keywords for SEO without keyword stuffing
9. Maintain a professional, credible tone while conveying appropriate emotion

Don&#x27;ts:
1. Don&#x27;t use jargon, acronyms, or technical language without explanation
2. Don&#x27;t include hyperbolic claims or exaggerations that damage credibility
3. Don&#x27;t bury the lead (main news) deep in the release
4. Don&#x27;t exceed 600 words total (aim for 400-500 words for optimal readability)
5. Don&#x27;t include unnecessary background information that distracts from the main message
6. Don&#x27;t use overly promotional language that sounds like advertising
7. Don&#x27;t include quotes that sound artificial or overly formal
8. Don&#x27;t forget to include contact information for media follow-up
9. Don&#x27;t use complex sentence structures that reduce readability

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

# NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH ALLIANCE LAUNCHES MOBILE HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAM TO REACH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

## New initiative aims to provide 5,000 free health screenings in first year

CITY_NAME, STATE — September 12, 2023 — Neighborhood Health Alliance (NHA) today announced the launch of its Mobile Health Screening Initiative, a new program bringing essential preventive health services directly to underserved neighborhoods throughout CITY_NAME beginning September 15.

The mobile unit will offer free screenings for common health concerns including hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol—conditions that disproportionately affect low-income communities but are manageable with early detection and intervention.

&quot;Too often, we see preventable health conditions develop into serious medical emergencies simply because people lack access to basic screening services,&quot; said Dr. Maria Sanchez, Executive Director of Neighborhood Health Alliance. &quot;By bringing these services directly into communities facing transportation and healthcare barriers, we can help thousands of residents identify health risks before they become life-threatening.&quot;

The initiative addresses a critical gap in CITY_NAME&#x27;s healthcare infrastructure. According to recent public health data, residents in the program&#x27;s target neighborhoods are 40% less likely to receive routine preventive care compared to the city average, despite having higher rates of chronic disease.

The mobile unit will operate five days a week at community centers, places of worship, and public housing developments throughout CITY_NAME. The program expects to provide approximately 5,000 free health screenings in its first year of operation.

Residents can schedule a screening appointment or learn about volunteer opportunities by visiting www.neighborhoodhealthalliance.org/mobile or calling (555) 123-4567.

**About Neighborhood Health Alliance**
Neighborhood Health Alliance is a nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating health disparities in CITY_NAME through community-based healthcare initiatives, education, and advocacy. Founded in 2005, NHA serves more than 12,000 residents annually through its programs and services. Learn more at www.neighborhoodhealthalliance.org.

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

# GREENFUTURE YOUTH COALITION RECEIVES $750,000 GRANT TO EXPAND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION IN UNDERSERVED SCHOOLS

## Three-year funding from Climate Action Foundation will reach 15,000 additional students

CITY_NAME, STATE — November 15, 2023 — GreenFuture Youth Coalition announced today it has received a $750,000 grant from The Climate Action Foundation to significantly expand its environmental education programs to underserved schools throughout the region over the next three years.

The funding will enable GreenFuture to bring its hands-on climate science curriculum, sustainability workshops, and youth leadership development programs to 50 additional schools beginning January 2024, reaching an estimated 15,000 students who currently have limited access to environmental education.

&quot;This transformative grant allows us to address a critical gap in environmental education equity,&quot; said Amara Johnson, Executive Director of GreenFuture Youth Coalition. &quot;When young people understand environmental challenges and are empowered with solutions, they become powerful advocates for their communities. This funding ensures that students in under-resourced schools have the same opportunities to develop these crucial skills.&quot;

The expanded program will include classroom curriculum, teacher training, field experiences, and community action projects. Schools participating in GreenFuture programs have reported a 65% increase in student knowledge of environmental concepts and a 40% increase in science engagement.

&quot;Environmental literacy shouldn&#x27;t be a privilege for some students but a right for all,&quot; said Marcus Chen, Education Director at The Climate Action Foundation. &quot;GreenFuture&#x27;s proven approach to engaging diverse students in meaningful environmental education makes them an ideal partner in our mission to build a more equitable and sustainable future.&quot;

Schools interested in participating in the expanded program can apply through GreenFuture&#x27;s website at www.greenfutureyouth.org/schools beginning December 1, 2023.

**About GreenFuture Youth Coalition**
GreenFuture Youth Coalition empowers young people to become environmental leaders through education, advocacy, and community action. Founded in 2010, the organization currently serves 10,000 students annually through in-school and after-school programming. Learn more at www.greenfutureyouth.org.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Recommended Model**: Use ChatGPT-4o for optimal results, especially for nuanced messaging or complex announcements. ChatGPT-4.1 is suitable for straightforward announcements when cost is a concern.

2. **Required Information**: Before using this template, gather all information listed in the CONTEXT section. The more specific details you provide, the more effective your press release will be.

3. **Customization Tips**:
   - Replace all placeholder variables: [ORGANIZATION_NAME], [CITY_NAME], etc.
   - For small organizations, emphasize community impact and personal stories
   - For larger organizations, include relevant data points and broader context
   - Adjust tone based on announcement type (formal for leadership changes, more energetic for events)
   - Consider your media targets and tailor language accordingly

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If the release sounds too promotional, ask for a revision focusing on newsworthiness
   - If quotes sound artificial, provide examples of how your stakeholders actually speak
   - If the release is too long, ask to prioritize only the most essential information
   - If you need more specific messaging, provide your organization&#x27;s communication guidelines

5. **Distribution Guidance**: After generating your press release, consider asking the AI to:
   - Create a distribution strategy for different media types
   - Draft accompanying social media posts
   - Suggest follow-up talking points for media interviews
   - Create a pitch email template for sending to journalists

Remember that this template creates the press release content only. You&#x27;ll need to format it according to your organization&#x27;s branding before distribution.</pre>
