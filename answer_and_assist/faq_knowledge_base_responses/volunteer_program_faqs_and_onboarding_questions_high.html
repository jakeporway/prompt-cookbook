## Customization Tips

### For Different Nonprofit Types:
- **Social Services**: Emphasize client confidentiality policies and boundaries
- **Arts &amp; Culture**: Include information about public-facing roles and event-based opportunities
- **Environmental**: Add details about outdoor conditions, physical requirements, and seasonal needs
- **Education**: Include information about required clearances for working with minors
- **Healthcare**: Highlight specific health/vaccination requirements and patient privacy protocols

### For Different Organization Sizes:
- **Small Organizations**: Simplify the response structure for organizations with limited volunteer roles
- **Large Organizations**: Add department-specific information and internal referral processes

### For Different Volunteer Management Systems:
- **Digital Systems**: Include links to volunteer portals, scheduling systems, and digital resources

## Troubleshooting Guide

If responses are:
- **Too generic**: Add more specific details to the knowledge base about your unique programs
