Example #1: Eligibility Question

Input:
&quot;Hi, my name is Maria. I&#x27;m a single mom with two kids (8 and 11) and I&#x27;m wondering if we qualify for your after-school program. I work full-time but don&#x27;t make much money.&quot;

Thoughts:
- This is an eligibility question from a prospective participant
- Need to check income-based eligibility criteria for the after-school program
- Should provide application information and financial assistance options
- Tone should be welcoming and supportive

Output:
**Personalized Greeting**
Hello Maria,

**Acknowledgment**
Thank you for reaching out about our after-school program for your children. I understand that finding affordable, quality care while working full-time can be challenging.

**Clear Answer**
Our after-school program is open to all children ages 6-14 in the community. Based on what you&#x27;ve shared, your children&#x27;s ages (8 and 11) would make them eligible. We do offer income-based sliding scale fees, and many working families qualify for reduced rates or even full scholarships.

To get started, you can complete our simple pre-screening form at [WEBSITE_LINK/prescreening] which will help determine what financial assistance you might qualify for. After that, our Program Coordinator will contact you within 2 business days to discuss the next steps in the application process.

Example #2: Complex Policy Question

Input:
&quot;I&#x27;ve been told I need to provide proof of income for the housing assistance program, but I&#x27;m paid in cash for some jobs and don&#x27;t have regular paystubs. What can I do? This is really stressful because I need help soon.&quot;

Thoughts:
- This involves our documentation policy but has some complexity
- The participant is expressing stress and urgency
- Need to provide alternative documentation options
- Should acknowledge the emotional content
- This may require staff follow-up for specific guidance

Output:
**Personalized Greeting**
Hello,

**Acknowledgment**
Thank you for reaching out about documentation for our housing assistance program. I understand this situation is stressful, especially when you need support quickly. Many participants have similar concerns about proving income when they don&#x27;t have traditional paystubs.

**Clear Answer**
We accept several alternative forms of income verification for situations like yours:
- A signed letter from your employer(s) stating your typical hours and pay rate
- Bank statements showing deposits
- Tax returns from the previous year
- A self-declaration form (in certain circumstances) where you document your income sources

**Next Steps**

## Customization Guide

### Organization-Specific Variables to Replace
- [ORGANIZATION_NAME]: Your nonprofit&#x27;s name
- [PROGRAM_NAME]: Specific program name (e.g., &quot;Housing First,&quot; &quot;Youth Mentorship&quot;)
- [BRIEF_MISSION_DESCRIPTION]: 1-2 sentence mission statement
- [CORE_VALUES]: List 3-5 core organizational values (e.g., &quot;compassion, dignity, empowerment&quot;)
- [TARGET_POPULATION]: Who you serve (e.g., &quot;homeless youth ages 16-24,&quot; &quot;cancer survivors&quot;)
- [PROGRAM_FOCUS_AREAS]: Main services (e.g., &quot;housing, mental health, job training&quot;)
- [WEBSITE_LINK/page]: Replace with actual URLs to resources
- [COORDINATOR_NAME]: Name of relevant staff member
- [PHONE_NUMBER]: Contact number for inquiries
- [EMAIL_ADDRESS]: Contact email for inquiries

### Knowledge Base Integration
1. **Prepare Your Knowledge Base**:
   - Organize program documents, FAQs, policies into searchable format
   - Consider uploading key documents as reference files
   - Create a simple categorization system for common questions

2. **Question Categories**:
   - Add/modify the question categories in the CONTEXT section
   - Create category-specific response templates for your most common inquiries

3. **Referral Thresholds**:
   - Define clear guidelines for when questions should be referred to staff
   - Create a contact list of subject matter experts for different question types

### Implementation Tips
- Start with 5-10 of your most frequently asked questions and create example responses
- Test with staff before using with participants
- Regularly update the knowledge base as policies or programs change
- Track questions that couldn&#x27;t be answered adequately to identify knowledge gaps
- Consider creating separate templates for different programs if they have distinct requirements

### Measuring Effectiveness
- Track response accuracy and completeness
- Monitor participant follow-up questions (fewer indicates better initial responses)
- Gather feedback from participants on response helpfulness
- Measure time saved compared to manual responses

### Troubleshooting
- If responses are too technical: Add more plain language examples to your knowledge base
- If responses miss key information: Review and expand your knowledge base categories
- If tone isn&#x27;t right: Modify the PERSONA section to better reflect your organization&#x27;s voice
- If responses are too long: Add length constraints in the CONSTRAINTS section</pre>
